**Text Quest is an advanced Text-based RPG set in medieval times. The player interacts with the game via various commands. The main story line revolves around the mysterious assassination of the king of the human capital. Naturally this is only the base story line and leads to various sub stories.**

# Event System #
The game's event system is scenario based. There are various types of scenarios, all of which are important and lead to side quests (side scenarios as referred to in the code)

# Battle System #
Naturally an RPG has combat, the combat system is very advanced and works quite well. I'm still working on damage calculation at the moment.

# Immersive Game-play #
The story line is very elaborate and will immerse you in a medieval world shrouded in war. The lore is rather large and changes with each update so keeping up to date is a very wise decision for all players.
